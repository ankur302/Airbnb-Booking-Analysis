# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis



Our Problem statement is to analyse Airbnb dataset provided by Almabetter. Our step ranges from reading the file to cleaning, visualization, hypothesis testing as well as answering custom questions.
Our initial steps involve reading the file, basic exploration of data description, statistical description of data, univariate and multivariate visualization.
On our next step, we checked for null values and handled them by imputation method. We even segregated our dataset into two sets based on ‘reviewed column’. Main purpose of the segregation was that, ‘reviewed column’ had a lot of null values and we didn’t want to drop as it could have important data pattern.
On our subsequent steps we explored our primary objective and its related secondary objectives where we utilised statistical methods to conclude on our hypothesis. New columns, ‘duration’ of business and ‘possible_year_of_start’ were created in-order to display hidden business operational trends. 
We did in-depth analysis of different business predictors such as ‘price’, ‘reviews’, ‘availability’, ‘minimum nights’ etc. in-order to understand which neighbourhood contributes more to the tourism economy.
For our next steps, we explored the top hosts and their business patterns including their property listings, booking costs, location, room types offered, etc. We even analysed the top hosts with potential to expand their business under Airbnb.
Our final objective included the exploration of the busiest/engaging area in our dataset.
We concluded with our observation from both data visualization as well as statistical methodologies which has covered all the objectives enabling the organization to take confident decisions revolving around the business.
